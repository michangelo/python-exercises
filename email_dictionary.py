    1. Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and
    figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
    2. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of 
    those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
    3. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail 
    address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
    After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary 
    using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
